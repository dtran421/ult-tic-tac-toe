# U3T AI

This project provides a user-friendly web platform to play the largely underrated and uncommonly known variation on Tic-Tac-Toe, known as Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (U3T). It also provides and employs several artificial intelligence (AI) strategies to allow users to experiment with and test their skills against several semi-sophisticated AI that I've developed. I worked on implementing three different automated approaches to playing the game: Random, Minimax, and the Monte Carlo Tree Search. Each have their advantages and disadvantages, which I'll outline in the following sections.
